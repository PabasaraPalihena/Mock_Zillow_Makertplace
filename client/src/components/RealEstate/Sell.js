              Deciding to sell your home yourself is referred to as
              for-sale-by-owner (FSBO). The FSBO process is similar to
              traditional selling, but without the help of a real estate agent.
              In this case, youâ€™re responsible for the home prep, marketing,
              showings, and negotiations.
